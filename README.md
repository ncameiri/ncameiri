## 🚀 About Me

I started my journey in the **Audiovisual world**, working as a **Lighting Operator**—an area I loved, where I mastered automation for intelligent fixtures like moving heads and other stage systems.

When the pandemic arrived and events were canceled, my workflow disappeared almost overnight. That’s when I spotted a **42 Lisboa** advertisement on the street and instantly felt it was the direction I needed to take. The logic and structured thinking used in lighting automation translated perfectly into programming.

My first exposure to programming came at **17 years old**, experimenting with **Arduino** modules. I burned a few boards (🔥😅), but that only fueled my curiosity. I built real-world projects involving:

- 🎛️ Light & motor controllers  
- 📟 Small display systems  
- 📡 Bluetooth, IR, radio communication  
- ⚡ Automation tools for everyday problems  

I became fascinated by how code could create physical, real-life impact.

Before joining **42 Lisboa**, I never imagined I could turn this curiosity into a full IT career. But through peer-to-peer learning and the intense challenges of the 42 curriculum, I’ve built the confidence and resilience to tackle the complex problems found in modern software engineering.
